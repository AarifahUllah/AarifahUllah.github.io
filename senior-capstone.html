            My year-long senior capstone design project was participating in Raytheon's Autonomous Vehicle Competition,
            a nation-wide inter-collegiate competition. We were tasked to design, build, and program unmanned aerial
            vehicles (UAVs) to complete a series of challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was honored to serve as the Team Captain for our 13-person interdisciplinary team across Computer Science,
            Mechanical and Engineering disciplines.
            Some of my responsibilities included leading team meetings, communicating with our sponsors, Raytheon, and
            stakeholders. I also managed the budget
            and contributed significantly to the algorithmic development, autonomous mission programming, and real-world
            drone deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our school won the Most Innovative Design Award for performing the best at competition day by having the
            best times. We also had a creative approach to the challenges
            that was atypical and noticed by the judges.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am also getting a patent as the sole inventor for designing an efficient method for autonomous navigation.
